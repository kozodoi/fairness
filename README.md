## Package overview

The `fairness` R package offers tools to calculate fair ML metrics across different sensitive groups. The metrics are computed based on model predictions in a binary classification task. The package also provides opportunities to visualize and compare prediction metrics between the groups.

The package implements the following fairness metrics:
- Demographic parity (also known as independence)
- Proportional parity
- Equalized odds (also known as separation)
- Predictive rate parity
- False positive rate parity
- False negative rate parity
- Accuracy parity
- Negative predictive value parity
- Specificity parity
- ROC AUC parity
- MCC parity

The comprehensive tutorial is provided in [this blog post](https://kozodoi.me/r/fairness/packages/2020/05/01/fairness-tutorial.html). We recommend that you go through the tutorial, as it contains a more in-depth description of the package compared to this README. You will also find a brief tutorial in the fairness [vignette](https://github.com/kozodoi/fairness/blob/master/vignettes/fairness.Rmd):

```r
vignette('fairness')
```

## Installation

You can install the latest stable package version from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=fairness) by running:

```r
install.packages('fairness')
library(fairness)
```

You may also install the development version from Github:

```r
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github('kozodoi/fairness')
library(fairness)
```

## Brief tutorial

### Loading the COMPAS sample dataset

```r
data('compas')
```

The data already contains all variables necessary to run all parity metrics. In case you set up your own predictive model, you will need to concatenate predicted probabilities or predictions (0/1) to your original dataset or supply them as a vector to the corresponding metric function.

### Computing a fairness metric

All fairness metrics are implemented as separate functions with the same structure of inputs including the outcome variable, model predictions and a sensitive group feature.

```r
compas$Two_yr_Recidivism_01 <- ifelse(compas$Two_yr_Recidivism == 'yes', 1, 0)
equal_odds(data    = compas,
           outcome = 'Two_yr_Recidivism_01',
           probs   = 'probability',
           group   = 'ethnicity',
           cutoff  = 0.5,
           base    = 'Caucasian')
```

### Examining the output

```
#>                Caucasian African_American     Asian Hispanic
#> Sensitivity       0.4720           0.7526    0.2500   0.4656
#> Equalized odds    1.0000           1.5943    0.5296   0.9864
#> Group size     2103.0000        3175.0000   31.0000 509.0000
#>                Native_American     Other
#> Sensitivity             0.6000    0.4194
#> Equalized odds          1.2711    0.8884
#> Group size             11.0000  343.0000
```
